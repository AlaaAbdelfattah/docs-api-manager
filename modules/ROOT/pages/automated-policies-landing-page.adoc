Automated policies make it easy for your API management team to satisfy compliance in common security, and logging requirements by automatically applying the same set of provided policies to all of your configured deployed runtimes. +
Your API development team can focus on building API proxies without worrying about compliance requirements because all of your deployed API proxies would inherit the configured automated policy for their runtime versions.

Automated policies ensure consistency and reduce possible errors because an administrator no longer needs to remember to manually insert a policy to enforce common standards.

All of the xref:policies-ootb-landing-page.adoc[Mule 4 Provided Policies] can be configured as automated policies. +
Policies can be configured to be applied at all the APIâ€™s running under a business group/environment.

== Support for Automated Policies

* Automated policies are only available for API Proxies based on Mule 4 runtimes and later, deployed in a cloud-based runtime plane (CloudHub, Runtime Fabric, and Hybrid).
* Automated policies have priority over any other provided policy applied to a specific API proxy that conflicts with the provided policy. For example, if an API proxy running Mule 4.1.2 has an IP whitelist policy to allow only the IP range 192.168.100.0/22 (from 192.168.100.0 to 192.168.103.255), and a new IP Whitelist automated policy is created to only allow the IP range 192.168.100.14/24 (from 192.168.100.0 to 192.168.100.255) to apply to all supported runtime versions (4.1.1 and above), then this latter automated policy will prevail over the former provided policy. +
Additionally, if there is an automated policy already applied, you cannot apply that specific policy as a provided policy in a specific API proxy.
