You can use multiple client providers, to help you enforce security and regulations in your business organization. These client providers, such as, OpenAM and PingFederate, enable you to secure your operational data, such as client credentials and access tokens. 

You can use an Anypoint Platform native client provider (default) or configure an external client provider. To assign separate client providers for different organizations and environments, you must first enable client applications to be authorized using OAuth for the client providers that you want to implement in your organization.

You use multiple client providers for:

* Different business groups
* Different environments, such as production, QA, and sandbox
* Internal and external APIs

== How This Works

When you enable external client providers, they act as authorization servers to issue tokens that enable client application to access an API. When you request access to that client application, the corresponding client ID and client secret are created in the IdP specified in that API specification.

If an API applies the Client ID Enforcement policy but not the OAuth policy, the client application is still created in an external client provider. 

When an OAuth policy is deployed to the API gateway, the platform automatically injects IdP configuration (such as the token URL and token introspection URL) to the policy. 

If no external IdPs are enabled, Access Manager acts as the default authorization server in that case.

== The Use Case

To better understand how to implement multiple external client providers, imagine a company, "Good Weather" that uses meteorology to forecast changing weather. Good Weather collects quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere at a given place and, using meteorology, predicts how that current state will change over time.

Good Weather has several sub-organizations running under the master organization. These sub-organizations exist based on the functions they perform, for example, Engineering and Forecasting. The Forecasting department researches and collects recent meterological data from various sources. This data is then consumed by various client applications. While the Engineering department maintains the applications that host the forecasting research data.

Because Good Weather must ensure that its weather-forecasting data is accurate and secure, the weather APIs are accessed only by employees of the Forecasting department. Good Weather also wants to ensure that the production APIs are the single source of truth at all times.

To ensure security and access segregation for different organizations, environments, and APIs, Good Weather IT sets up separate external client providers for the Forecasting department.

== Onboarding Multiple Client Providers

Your onbaording multiple client providers procedure differs based on how you have configured client providers and your business organizations in your company:

* *Scenario 1: No external providers configured:*
+
Creating and modifying such environments and APIs behave the same. The native Anypoint Platform client provider is assigned for such environments. The existing APIs and environment have no impact.
* *Scenario 2: External client provider configured:*
+ 
If you have external client providers, such as PingFederate, configured for your environments, the client provider is automatically ported when you onboard the multiple client providers feature. However, when you create a new environment, you must manually assign the correct client provider to your environment in Access Management. 

*Best Practice*
+
To secure your APIs by leveraging the multiple client providers feature, create one external client provider per environment. Assign the existing client provider to your production environment, while adding the new providers to other environments, such as sandbox, and QA. 

However, before changing any existing client providers, ensure that you check the impact on managed APIs and their consumers.



== Guidelines for Implementing Multiple Client Providers

Before you implement multiple client providers in Anypoint Platform, carefully review and understand the following points:

* When you change the client provider for an existing API instance, ensure that the API:
** Has no contracts
** Has no client provider-related policies applied, such as PingFederate and OpenID policies
* When you promote and import an API:

* If previously did not assign a client provider to an environment, after you assign an external client provider, all existing APIs in that environment still use the native Anypoint Platform client provider. 
+
You can then reassign the appropriate external client provider for that API.
* After you assign an external client provider to an API, you cannot return to using the default native Anypoint Platform client provider.
* If you remove a client provider from an environment, all existing APIs and client applications using that client provider continue to work.
* If you delete a client provider from a master organization, all existing APIs and client applications using that client provider default to the native Anypoint Platform client provider.
+
Even though contracts remain intact, policies that authorize against that provider fail because the configuration is deleted.

== Tasks for Implementing Multiple Client Providers Based on Roles

Based on your role and the needs of your organization, you might perform the following tasks to implement multiple client providers:

[%header,cols="20a,40a,20a,50a"]
|===
| Role | Task | Where to Perform | Notes
| Business Group Administrator | Assign multiple IdPs, including a default, to an environment. | Access Management | Using multiple IdPs provides flexibility to choose an IdP in API configuration inside API Manager, which can be useful when multiple teams are using the same environment for building APIs, but still want to use separate IdPs. This also helps in use cases when separate API instances are created for internal and external consumers, and separate IdPs based on a consumer is required. 
| Business Group Administrator | Receive notification about possible interruption to API consumers before changing IdP configuration.   | Access Management | None
// | Master Organization Administrator | Change the default IdP across all environments and business groups. | Access Management | Resetting the default IdP updates all environments across all business groups to a selected IDP, without affecting existing client applications. This way, when a new IdP is created for the organization, all environments are updated with just one change.
| API Manager Administrator | Review to which client provider an application belongs on the client administrator page to be able to differentiate between different applications with the same name. | Access Management | None
| API Owner | Configure an API in API Manager to automatically map to a default IdP configured by the business group administrator. The owner can also select a different IdP, if available. | API Manager | None
| API Owner | When promoting or importing an API between environments, specify an IdP from the target environment. | API Manager | If there is just one (default) IdP specified for the target environment, it is automatically assigned to the API on promotion. 
| Application User | Request access to an API based on the API instance that exists in a specific environment. | Exchange | When you select the API for which you want to request access, you must first choose the API instance to which you are requesting access. The API instance is filtered based on the environment.
|===

== Configuring Multiple Client Providers User Flow

Returning to the Good Weather use case, imagine that the company uses the following flow to implement multiple external client providers in their organization:

image::multiple-IdP-user-flow.png[User Flow for Configuring Multiple External Client Providers]

As shown in the diagram, you first configure your external client provider and assign it to the appropriate business groups and environments. When you create or modify an API within a specific business group or environment, the new client provider is displayed. You can reselect the appropriate client provider. 

When you promote an API to another environment, the target environment must have the client provide configured as in the source environment. Otherwise, the promotion does not complete successfully. 

As an API consumer, you can request access to an API based on the API instance in a specific environment. 



== Configure Multiple Client Providers

To configure multiple external client providers:

. From *Access Management*, first enable xref:access-management::managing-api-clients.adoc[client management].
+
As an Anypoint Administrator, you must first enable client applications to be authorized using OAuth for the client providers to be implemented in the organization.
. From *Access Management*, xref:access-management::environments.adoc#add-an-idp-to-an-existing-environment[assign client providers] to environments and business groups.
+
As an Anypoint Administrator, you configure a client provider and assign it to specific business organizations and environments.
. From *API Manager*, xref::create-instance-task.adoc[create or modify] APIs using the new IdPs.
+
As an API Owner create an API, import an API from Anypoint Exchange or modifie an API in API Manager. Optionally, you can promote an API from one environment to another, and import or export an API, as described in the user flow diagram in the previous section. 
. From *API Manager*, xref:automated-policies-landing-page.adoc[configure policies].
+
As an API Manager Administrator, you can apply policies to an API based on the client provider associated with it.
. From *Exchange*, xref:exchange::to-request-access.adoc[request access] to an API instance within a specific environment for business organization.
+
As an API consumer, you can request access to an API instance from registered client applications using private Exchange or public portals.
