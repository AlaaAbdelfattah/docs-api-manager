:keywords: credential providers, external client providers

You can use multiple client providers, to help you enforce security and regulations in your business organization. These client providers, such as, OpenAM and PingFederate, enable you to secure your operational data, such as client credentials and access token. 

In Anypoint Platform, you can segregate client application management for:

* Different business groups
* Different environments, such as production, QA, and sandbox
* Internal and external APIs

If you do not specify a client provider for your environment or business group, Anypoint Platform uses its native client provider. You can implement a client provider within Anypoint Platform (internal client provider) or implement a remote or external client provider.

To assign separate client providers for different organizations and environments, you must first enable clients applications to be authenticated using OAuth for the client providers that you want to implement in your organization.

//@Tomas--Can we explain why one must chose internal or external.



== How This Works

//Need help here

When you enable external client providers, they act as authorization servers to issue access tokens to a client application for accessing an API. When you request access to a client application, the corresponding client ID and client secret credentials are created in the IdP specified in that API specification.

If an API has only applied the Client ID Enforcement policy and not applied the OAuth policy, the client application is still created in an external IdP.
When an OAuth policy is deployed to API gateway, the platform automatically injects IdP configuration, such as the token URL and token introspection url in the policy configuration. The IdP configuration is completely hidden from a user in API Manager.

If no external IdPs are enabled, Access Manager acts as the default authorization server in that case. 
//[PA:-Tomas not sure what the following statement is trying to say.]
// Any client apps (clientID/clientSecret) that’re created for accessing an API are created and maintained within Anypoint.
// OOTB OAuth policies with an external IdP can’t be applied 
// ClientId enforcement policy can be applied.


== The Use Case

To better understand how to implement the multiple external credential provider feature, let us look at the example of "Good Weather" company that is in the business of forecasting weather for a given location and time. Good Weather collects quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere at a given place and, using meteorology, predicts how that current state will change over time.

Good Weather has several sub-organizations running under the master organization. These sub-organizations exist based on the functions they perform, for example, Engineering and Forecasting. The Forecasting department researches and collects recent meterological data from various sources. This data is then consumed by various client applications. While the Engineering department maintains the applications that host the forecasting research data.

Good Weather needs to ensure that the forecasting data is accurate at all times. For that reason the weather APIs must be accessed only by employees of the Forecasting sub-organization. Good Weather also wants to ensure that the production APIs are the single source of truth at all times.

To ensure security and segregation of access for these different organizations, environments, and APIs, Good Weather IT sets up a separate external client providers for the Forecasting sub-organization.

//example of how they implement the client providers.


== Guidelines for Implementing Multiple Client Providers

Before you implement multiple client providers in Anypoint Platform, ensure that you carefully review the following guidelines and best practices:

* When changing the client provider for an existing API instance, ensure that:
** The API has no contracts
** The API has no client provider-related policies applied, such as PingFederate and OpenID policies.
* When promoting and importing an API:

* If you assign an external client provider to an environment, all existing APIs in that environment display Anypoint Platform in the UI dropdown. 
+
You can then reassign the required external client provider for that API.
* After you assign a external client provider to an API, you cannot change this client provider back to be the default of Anypoint Platform as a credential provider.
* If you remove an client provider from an environment, all existing APIs and client applications using that client provider will continue working.
* If you delete an client provider from a master organization, all existing APIs and client applications using that client provider will change to the default Anypoint Platform client provider. 
+
All contracts will remain intact.

== Configuring External Client Providers User Flow

Based on the use case explained in the previous section, Good Weather uses the following flow to implement multiple external client providers:

image::multiple-IdP-user-flow.png[User Flow for Configuring Multiple External Client Providers]

To configure multiple external client providers:

//why they need to perform each step. And what happens when they don't.

* Step 1: From *Access Management*, first enable xref:access-management::managing-api-clients.adoc[client management].
+
As an Anypoint Administrator, you must first enable clients applications to be authenticated using OAuth for the client providers that you want to implement in your organization.
* Step 2: From *Access Management*, xref:access-management::environments.adoc#add-an-idp-to-an-existing-environment[assign client providers] to environments and business groups.
+
As a Business Administrator, you must then configure multiple client providers and assign them to specific business organizations and environments.
* Step 3: From *API Manager*, xref::create-instance-task.adoc[create or modify] APIs using the new IdPs.
+
As an API Owner, you can create an API, import an API from Exchange or modify an API in API Manager. Optionally, you can promote an API from one environment to another, and import or export an API, as described in the user flow diagram in the previous section. 
* Step 4: From *API Manager*, xref::automated-policies-landing-page.aodc[configure policies] associated to the new IdP.
+
As an API Manager Administrator, you can apply policies to an API based on the client provider associated to it.
* Step 5: Optionally, from *Exchange*, xref:exchange::to-request-access[request access] to an API instance within a specific environment for business organization.
+
As an API consumer, you can request access to an API instance from registered client applications using private exchange or public portals.
