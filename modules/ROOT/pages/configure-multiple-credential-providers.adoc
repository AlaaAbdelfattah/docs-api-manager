:keywords: credential providers, external client providers

You can use multiple client providers, to help you enforce security and regulations in your business organization. These client providers, such as, OpenAM and PingFederate, enable you to secure your operational data, such as client credentials and access token. 

If you do not specify a client provider for your environment or business group, Anypoint Platform uses its native client provider. You can implement a client provider within Anypoint Platform (internal client provider) or implement a remote or external client provider.

To assign separate client providers for different organizations and environments, you must first enable clients applications to be authenticated using OAuth for the client providers that you want to implement in your organization.

You can configure multiple client providers to:

* Segregate client credentials across your organization based on your company policies. IdPs are added onto the master org and then made available to business group admins to associate with different environments. 
As a business group administrator, I want to assign an IdP to environments so that I can ensure my client segregation is enforced all the way down to API contracts. 
As a  business group administrator, I can assign multiple IdPs to an environment and also assign a default IdP. Having multiple IdPs provides flexibility to choose an IdP in API configuration inside API Manager which can be useful when multiple teams are using the same environment for building APIs but still want to use separate IdPs. This also helps in use cases when separate API instances are created for internal & external consumers, and it requires to have separate IdPs based on a consumer. 
As a business group admin, I should be notified and warned about any possible interruption to API consumers when I am about to change any IdP configuration.  
As a master org admin, I can change the default IdP across all environments across all business groups. Resetting the default IDP updates all environments across all BGs to a selected IDP without affecting existing client applications. This is to make sure that a user does not need to go to all environments to update the IDP when a new one is configured for the organization.
As an API Owner, when I configure my API in API Manager it automatically maps to a default IdP configured by the business group admin but I also have a choice to select a different IdP if available. 
As an API Owner, when I am promoting or importing an API b/w environments I should be able to specify an IdP from the target environment. If there is just one (default) IdP on the target environment then it’s automatically assigned to my API on promotion. 
As an API Manager Administrator, I want to see to which client provider an application belongs to on the client admin page to be able to discriminate between different applications with the same name.

* Different business groups
* Different environments, such as production, QA, and sandbox
* Internal and external APIs

//@Tomas--Can we explain why one must chose internal or external.



== How This Works

//Need help here

When you enable external client providers, they act as authorization servers to issue access tokens to a client application for accessing an API. When you request access to a client application, the corresponding client ID and client secret credentials are created in the IdP specified in that API specification.

If an API has only applied the Client ID Enforcement policy and not applied the OAuth policy, the client application is still created in an external IdP.
When an OAuth policy is deployed to API gateway, the platform automatically injects IdP configuration, such as the token URL and token introspection url in the policy configuration. The IdP configuration is completely hidden from a user in API Manager.

If no external IdPs are enabled, Access Manager acts as the default authorization server in that case. 
//[PA:-Tomas not sure what the following statement is trying to say.]
// Any client apps (clientID/clientSecret) that’re created for accessing an API are created and maintained within Anypoint.
// OOTB OAuth policies with an external IdP can’t be applied 
// ClientId enforcement policy can be applied.


== The Use Case

To better understand how to implement the multiple external credential provider feature, let us look at the example of "Good Weather" company that is in the business of forecasting weather for a given location and time. Good Weather collects quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere at a given place and, using meteorology, predicts how that current state will change over time.

Good Weather has several sub-organizations running under the master organization. These sub-organizations exist based on the functions they perform, for example, Engineering and Forecasting. The Forecasting department researches and collects recent meterological data from various sources. This data is then consumed by various client applications. While the Engineering department maintains the applications that host the forecasting research data.

Good Weather needs to ensure that the forecasting data is accurate at all times. For that reason the weather APIs must be accessed only by employees of the Forecasting sub-organization. Good Weather also wants to ensure that the production APIs are the single source of truth at all times.

To ensure security and segregation of access for these different organizations, environments, and APIs, Good Weather IT sets up a separate external client providers for the Forecasting sub-organization.

//Tomas how will they best implement this?

== Guidelines for Implementing Multiple Client Providers

Before you implement multiple client providers in Anypoint Platform, ensure that you carefully review the following guidelines and best practices:

* When changing the client provider for an existing API instance, ensure that:
** The API has no contracts
** The API has no client provider-related policies applied, such as PingFederate and OpenID policies.
* When promoting and importing an API:

* If you assign an external client provider to an environment, all existing APIs in that environment display Anypoint Platform in the UI dropdown. 
+
You can then reassign the required external client provider for that API.
* After you assign a external client provider to an API, you cannot change this client provider back to be the default of Anypoint Platform as a credential provider.
* If you remove an client provider from an environment, all existing APIs and client applications using that client provider will continue working.
* If you delete an client provider from a master organization, all existing APIs and client applications using that client provider will change to the default Anypoint Platform client provider. 
+
All contracts will remain intact.

== Configuring External Client Providers User Flow

Based on the use case explained in the previous section, Good Weather uses the following flow to implement multiple external client providers:

image::multiple-IdP-user-flow.png[User Flow for Configuring Multiple External Client Providers]

To configure multiple external client providers:

//why they need to perform each step. And what happens when they don't.

* Step 1: From *Access Management*, first enable xref:access-management::managing-api-clients.adoc[client management].
+
As an Anypoint Administrator, you must first enable clients applications to be authenticated using OAuth for the client providers that you want to implement in your organization.
* Step 2: From *Access Management*, xref:access-management::environments.adoc#add-an-idp-to-an-existing-environment[assign client providers] to environments and business groups.
+
As a Business Administrator, you must then configure multiple client providers and assign them to specific business organizations and environments.
* Step 3: From *API Manager*, xref::create-instance-task.adoc[create or modify] APIs using the new IdPs.
+
As an API Owner, you can create an API, import an API from Exchange or modify an API in API Manager. Optionally, you can promote an API from one environment to another, and import or export an API, as described in the user flow diagram in the previous section. 
* Step 4: From *API Manager*, xref::automated-policies-landing-page.aodc[configure policies] associated to the new IdP.
+
As an API Manager Administrator, you can apply policies to an API based on the client provider associated to it.
* Step 5: Optionally, from *Exchange*, xref:exchange::to-request-access[request access] to an API instance within a specific environment for business organization.
+
As an API consumer, you can request access to an API instance from registered client applications using private exchange or public portals.
