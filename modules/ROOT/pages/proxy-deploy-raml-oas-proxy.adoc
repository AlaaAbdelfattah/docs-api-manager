= Building a RAML or OAS API Proxy

API Manager 2.x allows you to use a RAML/OAS type of API Proxy, for all your Mule 4 based proxies.

== Configuring Your RAML or OAS API Proxy

. In API Manager, navigate to *Manage API* to create your API instance. 
+
You can create an API instance by importing from Exchange or by importing in API Manager. 
. From *Asset Type*, select *REST/OAS*.
. To configure your API proxy for this API instance, select *Endpoint with Proxy* in the *Managing type* field.
. In the *Proxy Deployment Target* field, select your deployment target for the proxy.
. Select *Check this box if you are managing this API in Mule 4 or above*.
+
The strict validation options are automatically displayed under the *Validations* field.
. In the *Implementation URI* field, type the URI for the backend service.

. Click *Advanced Options*.
. In *Proxy Version*, select *latest*. +
This value ensures that your API proxy uses the latest released proxy version.
+
Versions 2.0.0 and later are recommended for OAS/RAML specs, since these versions add native OAS support.
+
If you upload an OAS API specification to an API proxy version 1.0 or earlier, your API specification is translated to RAML.
. Check *Validate the inbound requests* and the *Query params* and *Headers* strict validations.
+
The strict validations option compares the headers and query parameters, and incoming requests to validate them against the proxy specifications.

. Select a scheme and port number for your API proxy. +
 Optionally, you can set up an API instance label and a response timeout.
