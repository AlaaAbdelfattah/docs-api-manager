= Building a RAML/OAS API Proxy

API Manager 2.x allows you to use a RAML/OAS type of API Proxy, for all your Mule 4 based proxies.

== Configuring your RAML/OAS API Proxy

. In API Manager, navigate to *Manage API* to create your API Instance. 
+
You can create an API instance by importing from Exchange or by importing in API Manager. 
. In *Asset Type*, select *REST/OAS*.
. To configure your API Proxy for this API instance, select *Endpoint with Proxy* in the *Managing type* field.
. In the *Proxy Deployment Target* field, select your deployment target for the proxy.
. Select the *Check this box if you are managing this API in Mule 4 or above* checkbox.
+
When you check the option, the strict validation options are automatically displayed under the *Validations* field.
. In the *Implementation URI* field, secify the URI for the backend service.

. Click *Advanced Options*.
. In *Proxy Version*, select *latest*. +
This value ensures that your API proxy uses the latest released proxy version.
+
Because Versions later than 2.0.0 implement native OAS support, these versions are recommended for OAS/RAML specs. +
If you upload an OAS API specification to an API proxy version 1.0 or earlier, your API specification will be translated to RAML.
. Select the *Validate the inbound requests* box and select the *Query params* and *Headers* strict validations.
+
The strict validations option compares the headers and query parameters and incoming requests against the proxy specifications. If the request does not match the specifiation, the request returns an error.

. Select your *Scheme* and *Port* number for your API proxy. +
Optionally, you can set up an *API Instance label* and a *Response Timeout*.
