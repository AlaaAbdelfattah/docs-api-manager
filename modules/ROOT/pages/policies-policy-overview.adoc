Policies differ based on several different factors, such as category, purpose, version, and configuration options. You must carefully review these factors, before you decide to implementation them in your environment. In this section, each of these factors are explained in detail. 

== Policy Architecture

Policies are implemented through coordinated communication between the following components:

* API Manager
* One or more API Gateway Runtimes, or Mule 3.8.0 Runtime or later
* One or more API proxy or API applications

Using API Manager, you can configure and apply policies to an API instance. An API version can have one or more API instances. +
A specific API instance can also be tied to a specific API implementation endpoint, which can then auto-generate an API proxy application. +
You can deploy an API Proxy to a Mule runtime.

Each API proxy application receives requests on HTTP or HTTPS URLs specified by the API. Normally requests are forwarded to the corresponding API implementation endpoint URL, and then the response travels through the API proxy application back to the requesting client application.

== Policy Injection and Enforcement

When you deploy an API proxy application for a specific API version to a Mule Runtime, any applied policies in the platform, or offline policies in the runtime, are injected into the API proxy. This changes the behavior of the application. When the proxy application receives a new request, all injected policies are applied to decide if, and how, the request is forwarded to the API implementation endpoint.

In this way, the actual policy enforcement occurs inside the proxy application itself, minimizing the cross talk between the API proxy, which is processing the received request, the Anypoint Platform agent, and online API Manager. The API proxy application does not require any communication with the Anypoint Platform agent running in the runtime, nor does it require any communication with API Manager.

However, the Anypoint Platform agent remains connected to API Manager. After policies are reconfigured or removed from API Manager, those policies are downloaded to any connected API Gateway or Mule runtimes, which updates each runtime /policies folder. The policy changes are then again injected into each API proxy application. This allows policies to be dynamically changed without having to redeploy the API proxy application, and without having to restart the API Gateway or Mule runtimes.



== Policy Scope

Policies are isolated from the application and other policies. However, there are ways to expose information from a policy. The authentication information about a policy can be propagated in the Security Context Principal object.

Some policies, such as the token enforcement policy, allow propagation of headers, including the information related to the token. This token is used by the implementation service or by the API itself.

== Policy Size

The size of a policy varies based on its dependencies. The first time Mule Runtime polls for policies it will take longer to fetch them. However, after policies are retrieved, they are cached on the file system. This ensures offline availability and also reduces latency to fetch policies.

== Policy Level

Policies implement an additional level of granularity, where access is controlled based on a criteria. In this level of granularity, policies are applied to only those request that match the criteria.  These polices are known as resource-level policies. All policies, except the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy, are resource-level.

Resource level policy support includes RAML and HTTP-based APIs (since Mule 4). A policy applied at a resource level affects all HTTP methods, for example, PUT, GET, POST, or selected HTTP methods, within the resource.

You can apply multiple conditions to filter your resources and HTTP methods. The URI template regex can be applied to one, many, or all the methods that your API has. The uses for resource level policies are limitless. Listed below are a few examples of how you might implement the resource-level policies:

* Applying policies to specific resources
* Securing a subset of an API
* Setting different limits on resources

If you have a RAML/OAS spec attached to your API, click Preview Resource Matching to check which resources your filters affect.

== Policies and SLAs

You can configure specific policies to adhere to predefined SLAs. You create tiers of access depending on one of the following SLA tiers applied to the application:

* A tier that limits requests to three per minute. No approval required.
* A tier that limits requests to five per minute and requires API Versions Owner approval of the application that wants to access the API.

With SLAs, you limit access to one API resource. Access to other resources are unlimited. When an app attempts to consume the protected resource, the policy is enforced. The request must include the expected user name and password. Repeated calls within SLA limits from the app to the API succeed; others fail.

//SLA tiers should link to all the documentation on contracts, request api access and those flows.

//== Policy Lifecycle

// Add content here -- Eva?
// we should have a section on lifecycle to show how to upgraded to latest versions and promote them to do it.
