This policy logs a custom message with the information available from policies, proxy, and the backend, at any point of the execution. This policy works with both Apache log4j and Apache log4j2.

== Prerequisites

You must have the Anypoint Platform organization administrator (OrgAdmin) role or have permissions to create or manage APIs.

== How This Policy Works

Logging a policy consists of the following sequence:

. A request is sent to the API.
. The message is logged, if the following conditions are true:
** The level and category of the log defined in the policy are included in the logger defined in the log4j2.xml configuration file.
** The conditional field of the policy was not set, or was set, and the condition was met.
. The API response is returned. Message Logging Policy does not interfere with the execution of any policy nor its flow.
. The message appears in the application log.

== About the Logging Format

A message log uses the following format: 
+
`<date> <thread name> <level> <category>: <message>`
+
`date`: The date and timestamp when the message is logged.
`thread name`: The event thread for which the message is logged.
`level`: The logging level or type of the message, which is the same as log4j levels.
+
For more information, see https://www.tutorialspoint.com/log4j/log4j_logging_levels.htm[log4j Logging Levels].
//Nahuel--what are the various levels?
`category`: This parameter value is always `org.mule`.
`message`: This parameter value is always "the payload".
+
Example:
`2018-01-25 18:57:29,907 [WrapperListener_start_runner] INFO org.mule: the payload`

== Understanding the Logging States

The message logging occurs at various events for a request. These logging states include:

Before logging an API flow:

After logging an API flow:

Error handler after API flow:

== Configuring Policy Parameters

When you apply the Message Logging policy to your API from the UI, you can configure the following parameters:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Message |A DataWeave expression that's transformed into a message to be logged.
Note: If the payload is used as part of the message log, do not configure the Listener as non-repeatable (by default this setting is off).
|Conditional |The condition expressed as a DataWeave expression that returns true or false that needs to be satisfied to log the message. This field is optional.
|Category |The category that the log has. This parameter is optional. If no category is set, the default is the `org.mule.runtime.logging.policy-<policy id>` value.
|Level |Defines if the message is logged according to the configuration in your log4j2 file.
|Before Calling API |Set to cause your logging policy to be applied before the API is called.
|After Calling API |Set to cause your logging policy to be applied after the API is called.

== Example of Logging Policy in XML

The following flow shows an example logging policy:
