You might want to delete a API Group instance if it is no longer required based on your business needs. If you want to delete the API Group itself, you must first one-by-one delete all the associated API Group instances.

=== To Delete an API Group:

. From the left menu in API Manager, click *API Groups*.
. Select the version of the API Group that you want to delete.
. From the top-right corner of the window, click the ellipses button, and click *Delete*.
