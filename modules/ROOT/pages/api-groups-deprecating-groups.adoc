You might want to deprecate an API Group if a more recent version of the group exists. Deprecating an API Group from API Manager does not deprecate the API Group asset in Exchange. 

To deprecate an asset in Exchange, see xref:exchange::to-deprecate-asset.adoc[to deprecate asset].

=== To Deprecate an API Group:

. From the left menu in API Manager, click *API Groups*.
. Select the version of the API Group that you want to deprecate.
. From the top-right corner of the window, click the ellipses button, and click *Deprecate*.
// +
// Note that you can undo this action to return a deprecated API Group to a working state.
