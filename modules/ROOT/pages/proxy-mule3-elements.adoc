== Automatically Filtering Internal Mule HTTP Headers

To avoid internal Mule HTTP headers from being leaked to the backend implementation or from being included in the response, use one of the following two filters, as appropriate:

* To avoid the internal Mule HTTP header from being leaked to the backend implementation, use the following filter:

```
 <custom-processor class="com.mulesoft.gateway.extension.ProxyRequestHeadersProcessor" />
```
```
* To avoid the internal Mule HTTP header from being included in the response, use the following filter:
<custom-processor class="com.mulesoft.gateway.extension.ProxyResponseHeadersProcessor" />
```

Currently, there are no customizations available for these filters.
