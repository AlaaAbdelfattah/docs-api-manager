= Domain Support for API Proxies

Mule runtime allows share common resources among other Mule applications by defining these resources within a Mule Domain, and declaring other Mule applications to inherit this domain. This way, all resources declared in your domain, can be accessed by all Mule applications under it. +
More information about this can be found in the runtime's xref:4.1@mule-runtime::shared-resources.adoc[Shared Resources] topic.

Since each auto-generated proxy is a pre-configured Mule application, you can also define multiple API Proxies under the same domain.

Typically, API Proxy users install a domain when auto-deploying multiple proxies that have to use the same host and port and only vary their path. +
API Proxies deployed to CloudHub and to a standalone runtime, rely on a domain that includes common configuration parameters.
