= Automatic Domain Support for Mule 4 API Proxies

Mule runtime allows share common resources among other Mule applications by defining these resources within a Mule Domain, and declaring other Mule applications to inherit this domain. This way, all resources declared in your domain, can be accessed by all Mule applications under it. +
More information about this can be found in the runtime's xref:4.1@mule-runtime::shared-resources.adoc[Shared Resources] topic.

Since each auto-generated proxy is a pre-configured Mule application, you can also define multiple API Proxies under the same domain. +

Typically, API Proxy users install a domain when auto-deploying multiple proxies that have to use the same host and port and only vary their path. +
If you are deploying to a Hybrid deployment target, and your API Proxy is based on Mule 4.x,  you can configure your proxy to automatically inherit an API Proxy domain.

== Automatically Configuring and Deploying an API Proxy to Reference a Domain

If you are deploying a proxy to an Hybrid deployment target, and the proxy is based on Mule 4.x, API Manager allows you to automatically configure this proxy to inherit an existing API proxy domain.

You can download a specific API Proxy domain from Exchange following https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/org.mule.examples/gateway-proxy-domain/[this link]. +
Configure all your necessary resources and deploy this proxy domain.

Whenever you want to deploy a Mule 4.x API Proxy to inherit this domain, you can follow this process to have it automatically configured:

. In the *API Administration* tab, select *Manage API* and either import the API from Exchange, or from your local machine.
. Define you API Name, asset type, and version and asset versions.
. In *Managing Type* select *Endpoint with Proxy*, and then in *Proxy Deployment Target* select *Hybrid*.
. In *Mule Version* select the *Check this box if you are managing this API in Mule 4 or above* checkmark.
. In *Implementation URI*, type in your API's URI. +
Additionally you can specify:
.. A TLS Context. +
See the xref:building-https-proxy.adoc[Building an HTTPS API Proxy] article for more information.
.. The path for your implementation URI if it's diferent than `/`.
. Click the *Advanced Options* drop-down.
. Select your schema (HTTP/HTTPS) and optionally an API Instance label.
. Specify the port for your API Proxy inbound connections, and optionally set a response timeout.
. Select the *Reference User Domain* check-mark.
. Click *Save*.

After saving these configurations, in the *Settings* tab, under *Deployment Configuration*, click *Deploy*.

=== Manual Configuration

If you choose to download your API Proxy and configure it manually on your end, you need to keep in mind the following details:

* Add the API Gateway domain dependency to your API Proxy's pom.xml file:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<groupId>com.anypoint.mulesoft</groupId>
<artifactId>gateway-proxy-domain</artifactId>
<version>1.0.0</version>
<packaging>mule-domain</packaging>
----
* You have two listeners name:
+
** `api-proxy-listener-http`. +
Binds to all interfaces and uses port 8081
** `api-proxy-listener-https`. +
The listener configuration for HTTPS communications. +
To use it you must uncomment code from your API Proxy template and configure your certificates and passwords.
+
Your API Proxy listeners should inherit your Proxy domain HTTP Listener configuration by using any of these listeners name:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:listener-config name="api-proxy-listener-http">
  <http:listener-connection host="0.0.0.0" port="${proxy.port}" protocol="${implementation.protocol}"/>
</http:listener-config>
----
* The domain you inherit contains a file with default properties in its `config.properties` file. This resource provides settings dynamically without the need to recompile the domain. +
The properites in this file are:
+
[source,Properties,linenums]
----
proxy.port=8081
implementation.protocol=HTTP
inbound.keystore.path=path
inbound.keystore.keyPassword=changeit
inbound.keystore.password=changeit
inbound.keystore.algorithm=
inbound.keystore.type=JKS
inbound.keystore.alias=alias
----

== Avoiding Port Conflicts

To successfully register an API, you must deploy the API proxy to a Mule runtime using a unique endpoint URL. Automatically generated proxies use the path `+http://0.0.0.0:8081+`. To avoid a conflict, ensure that the proxy paths and ports are different.

Servers try to expose every interface, privileging the most declarative ones. For example `local_ip` is privileged against `localhost`.
