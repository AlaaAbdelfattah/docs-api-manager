//any ret codes to add here Mariano?

The Header Removal policy removes all listed headers from a request or a response of a message. When you configure this policy for your API, you must specify an inbound and outbound map of the headers that you want to remove from the message processing in the form of a key-value pair.

//Mariano can we add some text about what's happening in this diagram?

You can optionally include Mule runtime engine (Mule) expressions for Mule 3.0 and DataWeave expressions for Mule 4.0 in the value of the header:

`“#[attributes.requestPath]”`

//We need some more details 

== How This Policy Works

The `content-type` and `content-length` headers of a request can be filtered by this policy, as well as the host header. In the response, only the `content-type` header is removed.
