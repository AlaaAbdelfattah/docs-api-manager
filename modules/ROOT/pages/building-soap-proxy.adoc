= Build SOAP API Proxies

API Manager 2.x enables you to use SOAP API proxies for your SOAP-based web services. The SOAP proxy requires a WSDL definition that describes the backend service. The  WSDL enables the API proxy to perform validations on incoming requests and correctly routes outbound requests to the corresponding API endpoint. 

Based on your configuration, validations are performed either against the SOAP message schema and the envelope, or only the envelope. By default, only envelope validations are performed.

== How SOAP Proxies schemas are Validated

When you enable validations for an API, the SOAP action in the inbound request is matched against the same-named operation in the WSDL. After the matching operation is obtained, the proxy validates whether the namespace URI of the element and the name associated with the operation matches the same details in the incoming request. 

If the validation fails, an error message informing the expected namespace URI and element name is generated. If the SOAP action in the inbound request is empty, the application attempts to match the namespace URI and element name of the incoming request element to all the operations defined in the WSDL. 

The first operation that matches the incoming request determines whether the validation is successful. If the match fails, an error message is generated with the suggested tag names for the element in the request.

If you have disabled validations for an API, only the envelope is validated by verifying whether the inbound element contains a valid soap envelope with the correct namespace based on the soap version of the binding being invoked.

== Retrieving the WSDL Definition from the Proxy Application

The SOAP proxy allows POST requests to the backend web service and a GET request for the service WSDL. The GET request is performed by an HTTP GET method with “wsdl” as the query parameter:

`http://my-proxy-url:myProxyPort?wsdl`
+
Or
+
`http://my-proxy-url:myProxyPort?WSDL`

== Configuring your SOAP Proxy

To configure your SOAP proxy:

. In API Manager, select *Manage API > Create new API* to create your API Instance.
+
Alternatively, you can also import a previously exported API configuration zip file or manage an API from exchange.
. In the *Name* field, specify a name for the API.
. From the *Asset type* field, select `SOAP API - WSDL`. 
. In the *File upload* field, upload the corresponding WSDL file and click *Continue*.
+
Alternatively, you can specify the URL link to the web service hosting the WSDL, in the *File URL* field.
+

. To configure your API proxy for this API instance, from the *Managing Type* field on the Endpoint configuration page, select the *Endpoint with Proxy* option.
. In the *Proxy deployment target* section, select from the available deployment targets displayed.
. If you are managing this API in Mule 4 or later, select the *Mule version* checkbox and specify appropriate details in the *Service Name*, *Service Port*, and *Service Namespace* fields. 
You must have obtained these values from the WSDL.
. In the *Implementation URI* field, specify the URL.
. Click *Advanced options* and perform the following steps:
+

.. In the *Proxy Version* field, select `latest`. 
+
This value ensures that your API proxy uses the latest released proxy version.
.. Select the *Validations* checkbox if you want schema validations to be performed on incoming requests.
.. Select your scheme and port number for your API proxy from the respective fields. 
.. Optionally, specify an API instance label and response timeout period in the *API Instance label* and a *Response Timeout* fields.
. Click *Save*.

== Troubleshooting SOAP Proxy for Missing Imports on XSD Files

A SOAP proxy can fail during deploy time due to an incorrect WSDL definition. For example, the following error indicates missing imports in one of the XSD files that are a part of the WSDL: 

[source,text,linenums]
----
org.xml.sax.SAXParseException; systemId: http://localhost:8080/?wsdl304785538; 
lineNumber: 2; columnNumber: 52; src-resolve.4.2: Error resolving component 
'myNamespace:myElement’. It was detected that 'myNamespace:myElement' is in namespace 
'http://my.namespace.url', but components from this namespace are not referenceable 
from schema document 'http://localhost:8080/?wsdl304785538'. If this is the incorrect
namespace, perhaps the prefix of 'myNamespace:myElement' needs to be changed. If this 
is the correct namespace, then an appropriate 'import' tag should be added to 
'http://localhost:8080/?wsdl304785538'.
----

This issue occurs when the definition of an element that is used in the WSDL file is found in an external XSD with another namespace instead of the current WSDL file. 

You can resolve this issue by adding the appropriate imports in the WSDL file. For example, for the exception in the previous example, the WSDL file must contain the following import in the types element:

[source,text,linenums]
----
<types>
<schema xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
<import namespace="http://my.namespace.url" schemaLocation="myXSDFile.xsd"/>
</schema>
</types>
----
