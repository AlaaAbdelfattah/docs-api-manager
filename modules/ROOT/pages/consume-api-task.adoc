This procedure assumes you set up an API, designed an API, and then simulated calling the API. Because you provided a baseURI in the RAML definition, you can get the actual data from the service, for example `JSONPlaceholder` instead of the example data in your user-example.json include file. You turn off the mocking service, which provides a mock implementation of the API, and use the actual baseURI.

. From the API Administration page, click the product version number.
. On the API version details page, click Edit API in API Designer.
. Turn _off_ the mocking service in API Console.
. Save all files in the project.
. Configure a proxy and deploy the API to Cloudhub.
. Issue the following call in a browser to get the actual user list:
+
`+http://placeholder.cloudhub.io/users+`

The actual user list from the JSONplaceholder site appears.

Alternatively, you can use Try It in API Console to get the actual user list.
