API proxies, also known as "autogenerated proxies", are meant to enhance the usability of API Manager in your Mule application.

*Typical usage*: Either when you want to leverage API Gateway capabilities and your backend API is not based on Mule Runtime, or when your API is based on Mule Runtime but you are unable to define the corresponding Autodiscovery element because it is a closed code.

When you configure your API to be a Proxy Endpoint, Anypoint Platform allows you to download a preconfigured Mule application. If the application is deployed to a Mule Runtime and you are using the correct Platform Credentials, the API for the application will be automatically tracked by API Manager.

You do not need to know how to create a Mule application. You simply deploy the application to a correctly configured runtime.

[NOTE]
Anypoint Platform can deploy the proxy directly to Cloudhub or using the Mule agent, through Runtime Manager.

If you would like to use HTTPS instead of HTTP, you can follow these steps:

. Import the autogenerated proxy into Anypoint Studio.
. Specify the certificates to be used.
. Deploy the application to Cloudhub or a runtime instance.

The proxies that can be downloaded from API Platform are a convenient tool to speed up your Application Network development. +
Having said that, you are not restricted to using an autogenerated proxy. Any Mule application, provided with a correctly configured Auto-Discovery, can be used to leverage API Gateway capabilities.
