API proxies, also known as "autogenerated proxies", are meant to enhance the usability of API Manager in your Mule application.

*Typical usage*: Either when you want to leverage API Gateway capabilities and your backend API is not based on Mule Runtime, or when your API is based on Mule Runtime but you are unable to define the corresponding Autodiscovery element because it is a closed code.

When you configure your API to be a Proxy Endpoint, Anypoint Platform allows you to download a preconfigured Mule application. If the application is deployed to a Mule Runtime and you are using the correct Platform Credentials, the API for the application will be automatically tracked by API Manager.

You do not need to know how to create a Mule application. You simply deploy the application to a correctly configured runtime.

[NOTE]
Anypoint Platform can deploy the proxy directly to Cloudhub or using the Mule agent, through Runtime Manager.

If you would like to use HTTPS instead of HTTP, you can follow these steps:

. Import the autogenerated proxy into Anypoint Studio.
. Specify the certificates to be used.
. Deploy the application to Cloudhub or a runtime instance.

The proxies that can be downloaded from API Platform are a convenient tool to speed up your Application Network development. +
Having said that, you are not restricted to using an autogenerated proxy. Any Mule application, provided with a correctly configured Autodiscovery, can be used to leverage API Gateway capabilities.

== API Proxy Versioning

API Proxies follow their own versioning. When creating an API proxy, API Manager always uses the latest proxy version available. +
API Proxy version 2.0.0 and later add native support for OAS API specification and are also compatible with RAML 1.0 specifications.

You can specify the version of the proxy you want to use by clicking the *Advanced Options* drop-down menu and selecting the proxy version that best covers your needs.

== API Proxy and Validations

With Mule 4, you can now perform strict validations directly from API Manager. In previous versions, you had to download the proxy from Studio, modify the validation settings, upddate the XML configuration files, and finally repackage and deploy the proxy using one of the runtimes: CloudHub, Hybrid, or Runtime Manager. This was a complicated method, and required Mule Runtime and Studio expertise.

You can now modify the validation settings in API Manager when you create the proxy, and send it to any runtime to deploy it. When creating or modifying a proxy, you must use a proxy version later than 2.1.0. In Mule 4, strict validation is enabled by default.

When you enable strict validations, the application compares a request with the proxy specifications. You can perform strict validations for only query parameters, only headers, or for both. For RAML and WSDL proxies, you must have already created a specification.
