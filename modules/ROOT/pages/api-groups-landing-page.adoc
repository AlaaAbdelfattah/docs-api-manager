Using API Groups enables you to bundle your APIs and resources to solve specific user needs. Instead of using individual resources and APIs from a list, the users can request access to and use these in a package that solves a specific problem for them. 

When you create an API Group, you can customize instances of that group with different SLAs and rate limit conditions based on the problem the instance must solve. You can then publish the API Group to Anypoint Exchange so that users can subscribe to the package.

Because each API Group instance can include several API instances, and each instance can be included in multiple API Group instance solutions, package customization options are limitless. 

== How API Groups Works

As an API Group Administrator, you create an API Group for a specific organization and environment. API Groups are versioned, like the APIs contained within them, to more easily incorporate updates.  

The following graphic illustrates how you can implement API Groups in different environments.

== Example Issue to Solve Using API Groups

To better understand how API Groups facilitates API consumer engagement, consider the needs of a fictitious company named Good Weather, which forecasts atmospheric conditions for a given location and time by using meteorology. 

Good Weather enables customers to access requested results using the following APIs:

* Locations API
* Forecast API
* Current Conditions API
* Indices API
* Weather Alarms API
* Alerts API
* Imagery API
* Tropical API
* Translations API

Currently, the process that customers must follow to access and use the APIs is not efficient, requiring:

* Searching the Good Weather company portal to find appropriate APIs to actualize a business flow
+
To determine the precise API they need, customers have to search a long list of APIs on the portal. This difficulty is compounded when developers modify the existing APIs or introduce additional APIs. 
* Changing multiple API service plans individually to adopt a service-wide change 
+
This complicates the task of upgrading or downgrading of services.
* Working to access each element of an API when API access is approved
+
The API packaging does not restrict access down to the individual call and data elements. This introduces security issues and unnecessary overhead.

== API Groups Solution

Using API Groups, Good Weather can package different APIs based on consumer requirements and scenarios, with specific SLAs that do not clash with the requirements for other consumers. Good Weather can quickly adapt and absorb API changes. Using API Groups: 

* Good Weather can package different sets of APIs to target different consumers' requirements.
* API consumers can access a collection of related APIs instead of individual APIs, simplifying asset discovery on the Good Weather portal. 
* API Groups can enforce governance using SLA plans that can be modified with a single click.

The following screenshot illustrates the API Group packages that Good Weather created to meet their business requirements:
