= Create API Groups and Add API Instances
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

You can bundle a set of APIs to enable ease-of-use and efficiency for your API consumers. To create a bundle, you first create an API Group and then add the relevant API instances to it. If you want your API Group to be discovered by consumers, you must publish it to Anypoint Exchange.

When you complete the task of creating an API Group with the help of this topic, you would have created an API Group, the very first version of that group, and the very first group instance. Additionally, you would also have added API instances to the API Group instance.

You can add API instances to the API Group instance based on the environment (Production, Sandbox, or others) in which you create the API Group instance. For example, if you created a API Group instance in Production environment, you can add API instances to the API Group instance only from Production.

You create API Groups using the following steps:

*Step 1:* <<create-api-groups,Create an API Group>>

The first step to creating an API Group that can be used by consumers, is create an API Group. 

*Step 2:* <<adding-api-instances-to-groups,Add API instances to the new API Group>>

After you create the API Group, you then add API instances to this group for the first time.

== Task Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must have:

* At least one API instance in your organization or business group.
* Organization Administrators permissions to access all the business groups and environments in which your API instances are located. 
+
Otherwise, you may not find the required organization or business group in the list.

The *Creating a new group* page is displayed. You are now ready to <<adding-api-instances-to-groups,add API instances>> to the API Group.

== Add API instances to API Groups

Your API Group is not complete and functional unless you add the API instances to the group that you want to bundle. You can add API instances that belong in the same business group or organizations.

Note that you can add only those API instances that belong the same environment as the API Group instance.

To add a new API instance to a new API Group:

. On the *Creating a new group* page, select an environment from the *Select environment* drop-down list.
+
.The screenshot illustrates the fields and options displayed on the Creating a new group page.

. From the *Select an API* list, choose the API instance that you want to add.

. If you want to include additional API instances in the API Group, click *Add* and specify the details.

.. Click *Add Organization*.
