By default, a policy applies to the entire API, filtering traffic requests to every resource and method. You can apply only one policy with a particular `providedCharacteristics` at a given time in an API.

//Fede--what would 'providedCharacteristics' translate to for the customer?. I mean they need to understand what I'm talking about here right?

== Task Prerequisites

Before you apply a default policy, ensure that:

* Mule runtime engine (Mule) is installed with xref:api-gateway-capabilities-mule4.adoc[API gateway capabilities] enabled.
* An xref:api-instance-landing-page.adoc[API configured] with either a basic endpoint or a proxy endpoint, with the correct version of the target Mule version exists in API Manager.
* A Mule application is deployed with a xref::connectors:http/http-listener-ref.adoc[HTTP(s) based flow], which is linked to the API through Autodiscovery, also known as tracked flow.

Autogenerated proxies handle these prerequisites in most cases. In the case of default online-based policies, API gateway reconciles what is defined in the linked API in API Manager with the policies that must be applied to the tracked flow.

== Apply a Policy

To apply a policy:

* Go to *API Manager > API Administration* and select the API instance from the details window.
* From the left navigation, select *Policies > Apply New Policy*.

* Expand the policy that you want to apply.
* Select the policy version and click *Configure Policy*.

For details about the configuraion parameters for each of the policy, see the specific Xref:policies-ootb-landing-page.adoc[policy documentation].


// A policy extends the functionality of an API and enforces certain capabilities such as security. A policy can control access and traffic. For example, a policy can generally control authentication, access, allotted consumption, and service level access (SLA). You can apply policies to these types of APIs:

// * An APIkit project
// +
// For example, deploy the APIkit project to Anypoint Platform using API Autodiscovery and apply a policy.
// +
// * An API running on CloudHub
// +
// Design an API on Anypoint Platform, configure a proxy for Cloudhub, and apply a policy.
// * An API deployed to a private or cloud-based Mule Runtime 3.8.x or later
// +
// * An API deployed to API Gateway Runtime 2.x

// API Manager provides a number of policies. You can also build custom policies. You deploy a proxy API application and apply one or more policies to control how and when a received request is forwarded to its implementation endpoint. You can set an API alert to notify you when an API request violates a policy for SLA.
