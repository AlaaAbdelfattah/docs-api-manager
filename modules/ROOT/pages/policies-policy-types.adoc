Policies are available in different options, such as, Default, Custom, and Automated. Each type of the policy differs by its scope, management, and usability.

== Default Policies

Mulesoft provides several policies that are ready-to-use and cover different areas, such as authentication, security management, threat protection, and tokenization. You can apply any of these policies using the UI to any of your API endpoints. You can also use an API to apply policies.

After you apply a policy, it is managed by the API Manager for its complete lifecycle. You can apply a Default policy to a specific API. To automatically apply a policy to to all APIs in your environment, you must configure it as  a policy.

//It would actually be a good thing to add in the future, a section about CI and the link to the API API Manager portal. -- Eva?

//[PA]: DO we release new versions of an existing policy? How does it affect a customer that already has a version applied? What do they have to do with it.

== Automated Policies

You can apply any Default or a Custom policy to all the APIs in your environment, which is then referred to as Automated Policies. However, you require specific roles and permissions to apply Automated policies.

// what specific roles and permissions are needed. Ask Fede? Add a link to the roles and permissions documentation.--Ask Tobias Lichtig, Sergio Behrends or Tom√°s Bruno.

== Custom Policies

Even though Mulesoft provides a wide range of Default policies to suit your business needs, you might have a scenario that may not be covered by a Default policy. In such cases, you can create a Custom policy. You can extend an existing functionality, or define new ones with a Custom policy. These policies come in two different flavors, namely: Offline and Online.

=== Online Custom Policies
Online Custom policies are applied and managed by the API Manager, which is the default and recommended way to apply policies. Online policies enable you to manage the policy lifecycle by leveraging the platform. This way, the applied policies are always in sync with API Manager, and are protected by the Gatekeeper mechanism to perform client enforcement.

To perform client validations, you must pair the Mule Runtime with API Manager.

//How can they do this--Fede Balbi?


=== Offline Custom Policies
Offline Custom policies are applied directly to the runtime. You do need to apply them using the API Manager. However, you manage the policy lifecycle manually with this option. Because of the chance that a policy might be out-of-sync with API Manager, this option is not recommended. 

// Does this look fine? Anything else to add here? Eva, defe balbi?
