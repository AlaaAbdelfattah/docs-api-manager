API Manager 2.x was released in November 2017. If you created an Anypoint Platform account after the November release, use API Manager 2.x to manage APIs as described in this documentation. Otherwise, switch to API Manager 1.x documentation using the version dropdown in the left navigation.

You use Design Center to author and update RAML specifications if you created your applications after the November release. Applications are automatically deployed to CloudHub when you use Design Center to develop your APIs. 

To deploy an API proxy to other servers, you can use API Manager. 

You can manage Mule runtime engine 4.x APIs only with API Manager 2.x.
