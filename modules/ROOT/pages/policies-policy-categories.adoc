Policies are categorized by the function they perform. For example, because you are able to resolve issues with the help of logs, the Message Logging policy is categorized as a troubleshooting policy. The following table lists the Default policy name, its category and the function that it performs. +
You can apply only one policy with a particular `providedCharacteristics` at a given time in an API.

//Fede--what would 'providedCharacteristics' translate to for the customer?. I mean they need to understand what I'm talking about here right?
