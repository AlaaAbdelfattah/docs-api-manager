If you are using either an API Gateway 2.x.x instance or a Mule Runtime 3.8.x or above, you can follow these instructions if you need to access API Manager through a proxy.

== Prerequisites

The API Gateway runtime instance must be paired with an Anypoint Platform organization (or Business Group). +
Follow the xref:configuring-an-api-gateway.adoc#setting-up-an-on-premises-gateway[Configuring A Production API Gateway for Integration with Anypoint Platform] instructions to learn how to do this. +
If you are using Anypoint Studio, follow the xref:configuring-an-api-gateway.adoc#configuring-anypoint-studio-for-integration-with-your-organization[Configuring Anypoint Studio for Integration with Your Organization] instructions.

Use the procedure described below to configure an on-site API Gateway to point to a proxy.

[NOTE]
The only supported proxy authentication method in API Gateway runtime is Basic. NTLM is not supported.

== Anypoint Studio

. In Anypoint Studio, right-click the project name in the Package Explorer, select *Run As...* > *Run Configurations...*
. Select *Mule Application*, then open the *Arguments* tab.
. Copy and paste the following into the VM arguments box, leaving one space after any content that is already in the box:
+
----
-Danypoint.platform.proxy_host=<IP address or host name of the proxy server>
-Danypoint.platform.proxy_port=<port number of the proxy server (default value is 80)>
----
+

. Optionally, add a username and password for your proxy as follows:
+
----
-Danypoint.platform.proxy_username=<username to use for authentication>
-Danypoint.platform.proxy_password=<password to use for authentication>`
----

== Standalone API Gateway Runtime

. Open the  `wrapper.conf` file in the `<MULE_HOME>/conf` folder.
+
<MULE_HOME> is the value of the MULE_HOME variable, usually the root directory of the Mule installation, such as `/opt/Mule/api-gateway-2.0.0/`
. Paste the following code as a new item at the end of the list in your file, replacing the value of **`n`** with the next incremental values over the previous entries in the list.
+
----
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.proxy_host=<IP address or host name of the proxy server>
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.proxy_port=<port number of the proxy server (default value is 80)>
----
. Optionally, add a username and password for your proxy by pasting the following code as new items at the end of the list in your file, again replacing the value of **`n`** with the next incremental values over the previous entries in the list.
+
----
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.proxy_username=<username to use for authentication>
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.proxy_password=<password to use for authentication>
----
