Use API Autodiscovery to pair an API in API Manager to its deployed Mule application.

Setting up autodiscovery allows API Manager to manage the API. When set up correctly, it shows the API status, represented as a green dot if the API is being tracked, or a gray dot if untracked.

By configuring autodiscovery you can use policy management, and API Analytics, accessed from within API Manager. +
When autodiscovery is correctly configured in your Mule application you can say that your application's API is _tracked by_ or _paired to_ API Manager.

An API in a Mule runtime can only be associated with one autodiscovery instance. No two Autodiscoveries can be associated to the same API in a Mule Runtime.

== Prerequisites

To configure autodiscovery for your Mule application you need to meet the following requirements:

* API must exist in API Manager, configured with either a basic endpoint, or a proxy endpoint.
* Mule must be configured to use Anypoint Platform credentials.
** The platform credentials give your application access to the API Configuration in API Manager. These credentials must be set before starting the Mule runtime that executes your application. +
See xref:org-credentials-config-mule4.adoc[Configuring Organization Credentials in Mule Runtime 4] or xref:org-credentials-config-mule3.aroc[Configuring Organization Credentials in Mule Runtime 3] for more details.
* The autodiscovery element must be configured in your Mule application. This XML element must point to the specific API in API manager which you want to pair to.

== Proxy Endpoint vs Basic Endpoint

If you configured a proxy endpoint, your autogenerated proxy will already be correctly configured with the Autodiscovery element, and if you choose to take advantage of the platform deployment capabilities, such as 1-Click deployment, the API Manager credentials will be automatically set for you as well. +
Learn more autogenerated proxies in the xref:api-proxy-landing-page.adoc[API Proxy] section.
