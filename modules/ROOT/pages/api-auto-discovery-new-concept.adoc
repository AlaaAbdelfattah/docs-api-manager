Use API Autodiscovery to pair an API in API Manager to its deployed Mule application. 

Setting up autodiscovery allows API Manager to manage the API. When set up correctly, it shows the API status, represented as a green dot if the API is being tracked, or a gray dot if untracked.

By configuring Autodiscovery you can use policy management, and API Analytics, accessed from within API Manager.

== Prerequisites

The following conditions must be met:

* API must exist in API Manager, configured with either a basic endpoint, or a proxy endpoint.
* Mule must be configured to use Anypoint Platform credentials.
** The platform credentials give your application access to the API Configuration in API Manager. These credentials must be set before starting the Mule runtime that executes your application.
* The Autodiscovery element must be configured in your Mule application. This XML element must point to the specific API in API manager which you want to pair to.


//_COMBAK: I'd like to introduce this concept a little earlier and explain the difference between the two, so I can refer to this in the coming paragraph:
If you configured a proxy endpoint, your autogenerated proxy will be correctly configured with the Autodiscovery element, and if you choose to deploy using 1-Click deployment, credentials will be automatically set for you.

[NOTE]
An API in a Mule runtime can only be associated with one autodiscovery instance.
