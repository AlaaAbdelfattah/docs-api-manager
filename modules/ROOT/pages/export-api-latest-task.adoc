After creating an API instance, you can export it to a 100MB or smaller `.zip` file. You can later import the file into API Manager to create a new API instance. The format of the name of the exported file is {API name}-{version}-{API instance ID}.

Because the client provider is extracted from the target environment when importing the API instance, the associated client provider configuration is not exported with the API instance.

To export an API instance:

. In *Anypoint Platform*, click *API Manager*.
. On the *API administration* dashboard, click the API instance link.
. Click *Export*.
