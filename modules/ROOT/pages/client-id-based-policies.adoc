The Client ID Enforcement Policy restricts access to a protected resource by only allowing requests from registered client applications. The policy ensures that the client credentials sent on each request have been approved to consume the API.

When a client application is registered in Anypoint Platform, a set of credentials consisting of a client id and client secret pair are generated. Once the client application requests access to an API, a contract is created between the application and that API. An API that is protected with a Client ID Enforcement policy will only be accessible to applications that have an approved contract.

When you apply a Client ID Enforcement policy, access tracking of your API is enabled by reporting the client ID along with the analytics events. You can configure Mule runtime engine (Mule) to encrypt all sensitive information thar pertains to policies, contracts, and initialization data.

Default policies that internally enforce client application credentials include:

* xref:rate-limiting-and-throttling-sla-based-policies.adoc[Rate Limiting - SLA-Based Policies]
+
In Mule 3.8.5 or later, the following OAuth 2.0 Token Enforcement policies include a client ID enforcement validation:
* xref:external-oauth-2.0-token-validation-policy.adoc[Mule OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement]
* xref:policy-ping-federate.adoc[PingFederate OAuth 2.0 Token Enforcement]
* xref:policy-openid-connect.adoc[OpenID Connect OAuth 2.0 Token Enforcement]
* xref:policy-mule4-jwt-validation.adoc[JWT Validation]

Although token enforcement policies can optionally skip client validation, MuleSoft recommends that you enforce the validation to ensure that the token is associated to an approved contract.

== How the Policy Works

Every client application that wants to consume an API protected by a Client ID enforcement policy needs to have previously requested access to the API. After an approved contract exists between the application and the API, every request needs to include the client credentials in compliance with how the policy has been configured.

For example, if the policy has been configured to expect a client ID and client secret as headers, the application needs to make sure that those credentials are sent in the request using the corresponding headers.

== Configure the Policy

You can configure the Client ID Enforcement policy to obtain the client credentials in two different ways, HTTP basic authentication header and custom expression. 

*HTTP Basic Authentication Header*

You can configure the policy to require credentials as part of the Authorization header by selecting the HTTP Basic Authentication option. In this case, the application consuming the API must use the basic authentication to send the credentials in the requests.

*Custom Expression*

This options allows you to provide an expression each for client ID and client secret, specifying where to extract the credentials from the request. In Mule 3 you can provide an MEL Expression and in Mule 4 you must provide  a DataWeave 2.0 expression. Use this option when you want to send the credentials in a custom header or somewhere else in the payload. You can also configure the client secret requirement as optional by leaving the field blank.


=== Examples

You can configure the policy to extract the client ID and client secret from the HTTP request in several ways using DataWeave 2.0 expressions. When configuring the policy, if the client secret DataWeave 2.0 expression is not specified, only then the client ID specified in the HTTP request is validated against the protected resource.

The following examples use client ID as '1234' and client secret as 'abcd'.


==== With HTTP Headers

Example request using curl:
[source,text]
----
curl "http://localhost/myResource" -H "client_id:1234" -H "client_secret:abcd"
----

Example DataWeave 2.0 expression to be used when configuring the policy:
[source,text]
----
#[attributes.headers.['client_id']]
#[attributes.headers.['client_secret']]
----

In the above example, the policy is configured to expect two headers: client_id and client_secret, with the pair of credentials. The policy is flexible to allow other types of headers also. This is the default configuration for the policy.

==== With HTTP Query Parameters

Example request using curl:
[source,text]
----
curl "http://localhost/myResource?client_id=1234&client_secret=abcd"
----

Example DataWeave 2.0 expression to be used when configuring the policy:
[source,text]
----
#[attributes.queryParams.'client_id']
#[attributes.queryParams.'client_secret']
----

In the above example, the requester must send the two specified query parameters with the request. Although this is a supported configuration, MuleSoft does not recommended you to send the credentials as query parameters because of possible security risks. The recommended method is to use headers.

==== With HTTP Request Payload

Example request using curl:
[source,text]
----
curl "http://localhost/myResource" -d '{"client_id":"1234", "client_secret":"abcd"}' -X POST
----

Example DataWeave 2.0 expression to be used when configuring the policy:
[source,text]
----
#[payload.client_id]
#[payload.client_secret]
----

As shown in the above example, it is also possible to configure the policy to obtain the credentials from the request payload. MuleSoft does not recommend this option because it is harder to reflect in the API specification.

==== With Basic Authorization header

Example request using curl:
[source,text]
----
curl "http://localhost/myResource" -u 1234:abcd
----

Example DataWeave 2.0 expression to be used when configuring the policy:

To use the Basic Authentication as the origin of the credentials, no DataWeave 2.0 expression needs to be specified when configuring the policy.

=== Configure API Specifications

The Client ID Enforcement policy requires changes in your API specification to implement the credentials requirement.
You can find the RAML or OAS snippet link containing the RAML or OAS code you need to add to the API specification in the corresponding policy. You can access this code from the list of applied policies in the Policies tab of your API specification in API Manager.

=== Policy Output

When an HTTP request is performed against a protected resource for which the Client ID Enforcement policy is applied, and the client application credentials are invalid or unauthorized, the HTTP response includes a WWW Authenticate header with the following values:

[width="100%", cols="2,70"]
|===
>s| Custom mode | Header 'WWW-Authenticate'='Client-ID-Enforcement'
>s| Basic Auth mode | Header 'WWW-Authenticate'='Basic realm="mule-realm"
|===

For SOAP applications, the response will be a SOAP error.
