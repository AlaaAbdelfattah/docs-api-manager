Policies are by default applied to the entire API, unless configured otherwise. However, you can implement an additional level of granularity for policies, in which access is controlled based on the criteria. These are called _resource-level policies_. 

At the resource level of granularity, policies are applied to only those requests that match the criteria.  All policies, except the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy, are resource-level.

With Mule 4, resource-level policy support now includes HTTP-based APIs along with RAML APIs, as opposed to support for only RAML APIs in Mule 3. A policy applied at a resource level affects all HTTP methods within the resource: PUT, GET, POST, and selected HTTP methods:

You can apply multiple conditions to filter your resources and HTTP methods. You can apply the xref:configire-uri-template-regex.adoc[URI template regex] to one, many, or all the methods in your API.

== Usage Scenarios for Implementing Resource Level Policies

The uses for resource level policies are limitless. Listed below are a few examples of how you might implement the resource-level policies:

* Applying policies to specific resources
* Securing a subset of an API
* Setting different limits on resources

If you have a RAML or OAS spec attached to your API, you can use the *Preview Resource Matching* option to check which resources are affected by your your filters:

A resource-level policy supports regular Java expressions. For example, you can use the wildcard to apply a policy to multiple resources. When you apply the policy to the API, specify the resources to which it applies:

== Guidelines for Implementing Resource Level Policies

When implementing policies at resource level:

* Do not use a placeholder, such as {userid}, in the regular expression. 
+
Using a placeholder in an expression fails because the placeholder does not match the actual node. In the example placeholder {userid}, the node looks something like this:
+
`/api/users/671962fc-f076-4b19-bc38-45ba3a4e4095/permissions/1234`
+
** 671962fc-f076-4b19-bc38-45ba3a4e4095 is the user ID
** 1234 is the ID of a permission
* Apply a policy to your resource by using the expression: `/api/users/{userid}` 
+
The `userid` represents a single user and all resource nodes:
+
`/api/users/.*`
* Use the expressions: `/api/users/{userId/permissions}` and `/api/users/{userid}/permissions/{permissionId}` to apply a policy to only the permissions resources:
+
`/api/users/.*/permissions.*`
