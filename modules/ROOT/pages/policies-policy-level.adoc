Policies are by default applied to the entire API, unless configured otherwise. However, you can implement an additional level of granularity for policies, in which access is controlled based on the criteria. These are called _resource-level policies_. 

At the resource level of granularity, policies are applied to only those requests that match the criteria.  All policies, except the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy, are resource-level.

With Mule 4, resource-level policy support now includes HTTP-based APIs along with RAML APIs, as opposed to support for only RAML APIs in Mule 3. A policy applied at a resource level affects all HTTP methods within the resource: PUT, GET, POST, and selected HTTP methods:

You can apply multiple conditions to filter your resources and HTTP methods. The URI template regex can be applied to one, many, or all the methods in your API.

== Usage Scenarios

The uses for resource level policies are limitless. Listed below are a few examples of how you might implement the resource-level policies:
The uses for resource-level policies are limitless. A few examples are:

* Applying policies to specific resources
* Securing a subset of an API
* Setting different limits on resources

If you have a RAML or OAS spec attached to your API, click Preview Resource Matching to check which resources your filters affect.

//Where does a user click this?

Following is an example API for the usage scenario:

A resource-level policy supports regular Java expressions. For example, you can use the wildcard to apply a policy to multiple resources. When you apply the policy to the API, specify the resources to which it applies.

// were there differences between mule 3 and mule 4 in the expressions? if there are we should highlight them here -- Fede Balbi?

Do not use a placeholder, such as {userid}, in the regular expression. Using a placeholder in an expression fails because the placeholder does not match the actual node. In the example placeholder {userid}, the node looks something like this:

Example: 
`/api/users/671962fc-f076-4b19-bc38-45ba3a4e4095/permissions/1234`

* 671962fc-f076-4b19-bc38-45ba3a4e4095 is the user ID
* 1234 is the ID of a permission

To apply a policy to resource `/api/users/{userid}` that represents a single user and all resource nodes, use the following expression:

`/api/users/.*`

To apply a policy to only the permissions resources `/api/users/{userId/permissions}` and `/api/users/{userid}/permissions/{permissionId}`, use the following expression:

----
/api/users/.*/permissions.*
----
