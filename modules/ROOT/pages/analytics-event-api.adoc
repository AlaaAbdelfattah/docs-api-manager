:keywords: analytics, api, reports

API Manager gathers analytics data for each API that you manage.  You can generate this data in reports and charts, using the Analytics Event API. You can create reports for a specific environment, can span multiple APIs, or create different reports for the same API. 

The Analytics Event API provides a one month retention policy for events, with a data availability delay of up to 10 minutes. The Analytics Event API enforces a usage limit of 10 requests per minute, with a maximum of 20,000 events per request. Request rates higher than 10 request per minutes are throttled.

== Limitations

The Event API is designed to create ad-hoc reports, and is not intended as a data export tool. Before you export data, review the following recommendations:

** Do not allow calls to overlap time intervals.
** Retrieve all the data that you need in a single request. 
** Do not repeat the same request for every API that you have.
** Do not call the Analytics Event API more than once per minute.
** For organizations whose API usage exceeds 20,000 calls per 10 minutes, consider a different way for data export. 
+
You can configure API gateway to send usage events directly to monitoring systems.
* Do not use the Analytics Event API for data synchronization. +
If you need to synchronize data for events with an external system, see xref:analytics-event-forward.adoc[analytics event forwarding] for more information.

== Creating a Report

The following procedure describes how to create a report to find the API events. For example, you might want to find events that were rejected because of policy violations, such as rate limiting or IP blacklisting. 

To create a report:

. In *API Manager > Analytics > Manage Reports*, click *New* to create a new report.
. In *Create Report*, select a data source, range, and format.
. In *Fields*, select *Violated Policy Name*.
+
A URL appears that you can use to see the report after you save it. The date that data becomes
available for the data source you specified appears.
+
. Save the report.
+
When the report is generated, go to the URL to view it.

== Running a Report in the Browser

API Analytics lists the starting point for when data is available for the API, including a warning message if no data is available for the API.

To run a report in a browser:

On the *Manage Reports* page, click *Run* for the specified report.

After the report runs, a .CSV or .JSON file is generated with the analytics data for the specified parameters.

=== Using curl to View Report Information

You get the value of `$TOKEN` by running the curl command in this procedure. The command gets the `access_token` JSON property of this response.

The authorization header has the form: Authorization: `Bearer {$TOKEN.access_token}`

The use of the `jq` command-line JSON processor is one possible solution for obtaining the access token value. Download and install this application or one with the same functionality for this procedure.

To view report information programatically:

. Open a new terminal window and execute the following command:
+
----
TOKEN=$(curl -s https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login -d "username=<YOUR-USERNAME>&password=<YOUR-PASSWORD>" | jq -r .access_token)
----
+
This command sends a request to the authentication servers of the Anypoint Platform and, if the request is successful, returns an access token that's stored in the `$TOKEN` variable. The value of this variable is displayed below:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
 "access_token": "54545454-5454-5454-5454-545454545454",
 "token_type": "Bearer",
 "redirectUrl": "/accounts/#/cs/profile/home"
 }
----
+
. After you obtain the access, append it to the `Authorization` header in the request of the Analytics Reporting API endpoint for your report:
.. To make a request to this endpoint, copy it from the *Manage Reports* page in the Analytics dashboard. 
.. Using the `$TOKEN` variable from the previous step, include it in the next request as shown below:
+
This example retrieves the analytics for organizations without environments:
+
[source,console]
----
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/analytics/1.0/<ORGANIZATION_ID>/events?format=csv&startDate=2016-01-01&endDate=2016-12-31&fields=Application%20Name.Client%20IP.Resource%20Path" > output.csv
----
+
. If the request is successful, an `output.csv` file is generated in the directory from where you initiated the `curl` request.
+
This example queries the Events API for organizations with environments:

[source,console]
----
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "https://anypoint.mulesoft.com:443/analytics/1.0/<ORGANIZATION_ID>/environments/<ENVIRONMENT_ID>/events?format=csv&apiIds=<API_ID>&duration=30d" > output.csv
----

In this example, analytics data is retrieved for the past 30 days from the API with the API ID <API_ID>. The results are generated in a CSV format. The following example combines two curl commands and displays values in the command prompt window:

[source,text,linenums]
----
TOKEN=$(curl -s https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login -d "username=myusername&password=mypassword" | jq -r .access_token)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/analytics/1.0/42424242-4242-4242-4242-424242424242/events?format=csv&startDate=2016-01-01&endDate=2016-11-10&fields=Application%20Name.Client%20IP.Resource%20Path"
echo;echo
----

The following output is generated with this command:

[source,text,linenums]
----
"Application Name","Client IP","Resource Path",Timestamp,"API ID","API Version ID","API Name","API Version Name"
"Las Vegas T-Shirt serviceLas Vegas T-Shirt serviceLas Vegas",83.178.96.0,/,2016-10-03T04:27:02.072Z,61460,63811,"test api contracts",1
"Las Vegas T-Shirt serviceLas Vegas T-Shirt serviceLas Vegas",83.178.96.0,/,2016-10-03T05:03:38.774Z,61460,63811,"test api contracts",1
  ...

=== Supporting Environments

For organizations that have enabled environments, API events queried using the approach described in the previous section belongs exclusively to the "Unclassified" environment. 

To request events for APIs in a specific environment:

. Select the environment in the Environment selector and create the report that you want to run. 
+
Reports are stored based on the environment. Therefore, different reports exist in different environments. 
. Copy the report URL from the UI.
+
Note that in addition to the organization ID, the URL also includes `/environment/{Environment ID}`. Anypoint Platform assigns a unique ID to an organization and an environment when they are created. For example, an API ID in QA environment will be different from its ID in Production.

To access events for a specific environment, append the environment ID to the report URL. 

=== Reviewing Command Options

You can add the following options to curl commands:

[%header,cols="20s,80a"]

== Reviewing Data Fields for Reports

Your report can query data for one or more of the available data fields:

[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Data Field Name |Description
|Application |Client ID associated with the incoming API request.
|Application Name |Name of the application making the API request (only available when a client ID is passed with the request).
|Browser |Browser type associated with the incoming API request.
|City |The city from which the API request originated (inferred by the IP address of the client).
|Client IP |IP address of the client making the API request.
|Continent |The continent from which the API request originated (inferred by the IP address of the client).
|Country |The country from which the API request originated (inferred by the IP address of the client).
|Hardware Platform |The hardware type of the client making the request (such as Mobile, Tablet, Desktop, etc.).
|Message ID |Message ID value.
|OS Family |The client OS type: Mac OS X, iOS, Windows, Linux.
|OS Major Version |Operating system major version.
|OS Minor Version |Operating system minor version.
|OS Version |Operating system version.
|Postal Code |The postal code from which the API request originated (inferred by the IP address of the client).
|Request Outcome |Indicates whether a request was successful or resulted in a policy violation.
|Request Size |The size (in bytes) of the incoming client request.
|Resource Path |The path of the client request.
|Response Size |The size in bytes of the API response. See note below.
|Response Time |The processing time of the API request.
|Status Code |The HTTP status code of the response.
|Timezone |The time zone from which the API request originated (inferred by the IP address of the client).
|User Agent Name |The complete user agent string for the incoming client request.
|User Agent Version |The version of the user agent string for the incoming client request.
|Verb |The REST verb associated with the API client request (GET, POST, PATCH, etc.).
|Violated Policy Name |The name of the policy violated by the API request (if any).
|===

In your query:

* If the `Content-Length` header is present, the `Response Size` is set to that value. If the `Content-Length` header is not present and the payload is a String, Analytics calculates the length of the String and reports that value. 
* If the `Content-Length` header is not present and the payload is not a String, Analytics reports the response size as -1. 
+
For example, if the output returned is a DataWeave stream and the `Content-Length` header is not present, Analytics does not report a response size because the value is not a String. However if your application performs a String conversion, the response size is listed.
