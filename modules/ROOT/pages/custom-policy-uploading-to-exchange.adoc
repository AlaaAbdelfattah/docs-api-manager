Exchange provides an API to publish or consume assets using a Maven client. You must have a unique artifact name and organization ID to publish your asset. +
See the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/exchange-maven-facade-api-http/[Maven facade API] Exchange asset for more details.

API Manager lists custom policies published as assets of your organization.

== Deploying a Policy Created Using the Maven Archetype

When you create your custom policy project using the provided Maven archetypes, all the necessary plugins for uploading the policy to Exchange are already defined for you. +
See the xref:custom-policy-getting-started.adoc#setting-up-a-project-with-the-archetype[Setting up a project with the archetype] instructions for more information.

You only need to configure your Exchange credentials:

. Update the settings.xml file in your Maven `.m2` directory with your Exchange credentials.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
  <servers>
    <server>
       <id>Repository</id>
       <username>myusername</username>
       <password>mypassword</password>
     </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
----
. Run `mvn deploy` to publish the policy to Exchange.

The custom policy is now available for you to apply to APIs that belong to the specified organization.

== Deploying a Policy Created Without Using the Maven Archetype

If you chose not to create your custom policy project using the provided Maven archetypes, you need to manually set up your Exchange deployment configurations:

. Go to your `pom.xml` file and define your Exchange URL as a property:
+
[source,XML,linenums]
--
<properties>
  <exchange.url>https://maven.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v1/organizations/{OrgId}/maven</exchange.url>
</properties>
--
* Replace the {orgId} by using your organization's ID:
** Get your organization ID from *Access Management > Organization*:
*** Click the name of your organization.
*** Copy the UUID from the browser address. For example, copy _2a4b93c3-7899-4ea7-9374-f787744d8784_ from the URL.
. Additonally, in your `pom.xml` file, define Exchange as a repository:
+
[source,XML,linenums]
--
<repository>
	<id>exchange-server</id>
	<name>MuleSoft Exchange Environment</name>
	<url>${exchange.url}</url>
	<snapshots>
		<enabled>true</enabled>
	</snapshots>
</repository>
--
+
And set up your Exchange server as a distribution management:
+
[source,XML,linenums]
--
<distributionManagement>
    <repository>
        <id>exchange-server</id>
        <name>Corporate Repository</name>
        <url>${exchange.url}</url>
        <layout>default</layout>
    </repository>
</distributionManagement>
--
. Finally, set up your Exchange credentials in the `settings.xml` file in your Maven `.m2` directory:
+
[source,XML,linenums]
--
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
  <servers>
    <server>
       <id>exchange-server</id>
       <username>myusername</username>
       <password>mypassword</password>
     </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
--
+
[NOTE]
--
The IDs defined for your Exchange repositories must match.
