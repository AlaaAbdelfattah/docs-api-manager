The IP Blacklist policy controls access to a configured API endpoint from a range of IP addresses. 

The IP Blacklist policy restricts access to a protected resource when a match is found between a source IP (specified when configuring the policy) and a list of individual IPs or range of IPs.

Based on your business need, you can specify a DataWeave 2.0 expression for Mule runtime engine 4 (Mule)) or MEL expression for Mule 3.

== Specifying IP Addresses to Blacklist in the Policy

You can specify the IP addresses to block in the policy using the following ways:

* Blacklist access based on the IP address of the request
* Blacklist access based on the origin IP address that is determined by resolving a specific DataWeave or MEL expression, such as the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Forwarded-For[x-Forwarded-For] header or the `HTTP` header.
* Any other origin.

=== Blacklist Access Based on the IP Address of the Request

To blacklist access based on the IP address of the request, you can:

* Define a specific IP address by enumerating it in the white space, for example, `192.168.1.1`.
* Define a subset of addresses by identifying a subnet mask. 
+
For example, `192.168.3.1/30` includes the consolidated range: `192.168.3.0 - 192.168.3.3`.
* Define a whole range of IP addresses by specifying the relevant octets of the IP address that you want to permit. 
+
For example, setting `192.168` will include IP addresses from 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255.

=== Blacklist Access Based on the Origin IP Address of the x-Forwarded-For Header

If the client connects to your API through an HTTP proxy or a load-balancer, you can blacklist the client's specific IP (the IP originating the request) instead of the address that will appear in the request.

For example, suppose you want to blacklist `192.168.2.3` and the address of a client connecting through an HTTP proxy is `92.40.1.255`, the client requests appear with this public address using the proxy in such a case. 

Typically, applications use the `X-Forwarded-For` header to identify the origin IP addresses of a request that was redirected to your endpoint.

You can use a Mule expression to instruct the service to look for the IP address in the 'x-Forwarded-For' header:

[source,mel]
----
#[message.inboundProperties['http.headers']['X-Forwarded-For']]
----

When you insert the IP address in the IP expression field of the policy parameters, the API Platform is instructed to look at the first IP address that ranks in the concatenated values of the `x-Forwarded-For` header of the request:

== Configuring Policy Parameters

When you apply the IP Blacklist policy to your API from the UI, you can configure the following parameters:

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="a,a,a"]
|===
| Parameter | Description 
|IP expression  |The DataWeave 2.0 or MEL expression to be used for extracting the IP address from this API request. 
|Blacklist |The list of IP addresses that must be denies access to the API. You may define one IP or an IP range at a time, as many times required. For more information, see <<specifying_ip_address,Specifying IP Addresses to Blacklist in the Policy>>.
|Method & Resource conditions |The option to add configurations to only a select few or all methods and resources of the API.
