= Configuring an API Endpoint in API Manager

//Nahuel please review the whole topic and suggest changes
You can set up one of the following types of API endpoint management:

* Basic endpoint
+
Configure and directly manage a basic endpoint. Use this option when you have a Mule runtime Engine (Mule) application with autodiscovery correctly defined against your API.
+
* Endpoint with proxy
+
Use this option if you either have a Mule application for which cannot configure autodiscovery or if your API is implemented using a technology different than one used to develop Mule.

You can apply policies only to Mule applications that are configured with autodiscovery. Therefore, for the endpoints with proxy option, you need an auto-generated proxy to which you can apply policies and that it forwards correctly the request to the corresponding API (backend implementation).

You can save and later modify configuration of an API versions or instance.

To configure an API endpoint:

. In API Manager, click the version, or an instance of the API.
+
.The diagram illustrates the inputs you must provide to create the API endpoint.

+
<1> Add a tag for API endpoint, for example: `Deprecated`.
<2> The endpoint type: Basic or Proxy.
<3> The client provider if you have configured an external client provider.
. Optionally, specify the public-facing URL for the API in the *Implementation URI* field, for example: `+http://product.mydomain.com+`.
. Scroll to the bottom of the page to the *API Configuration* section.
. In the *Managing Type* field, select the endpoint type:

* *Basic Endpoint*: select if you have an API with autodiscovery configured.
* *Endpoint With Proxy*: select a proxy deployment target CloudHub or Hybrid installation. Hybrid is a product for managing servers. 
+
You can accept the default Path `/` for the proxy endpoint or enter another path. 
// For example, changing the path to `/users` makes the REST call to the service at the implementation URI `+http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users+`.
. Select the *Mule version* box if you want to manage APIs in Mule 4 or above.
. In the *Implementation URI* field, either specify the URL of the site that hosts the API or accept the default dummy URI.
. From *Client provider*, select the identity provider (IdP) that you want to use to authenticate access to this API from registered client applications.
+
If no client providers are set up for your environment and organization, this field is not visible.
// . In *Advanced Options*, optionally assign an instance label for the proxy, or accept the label, and set a response timeout.
. At the top of *API Configuration* section, click *ADD A TAG* to enter a tag name, for example: Released, to signal the status of an API version to users.
. Click *Save*.
