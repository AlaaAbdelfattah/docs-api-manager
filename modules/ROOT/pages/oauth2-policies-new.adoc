To secure an API in Anypoint Platform using OAuth 2.0, you may use the following policies and the matching OAuth 2.0 provider:

* One of the following policies available in Federated organizations configured with specific OAuth 2.0 providers:
** OpenAM OAuth Token Enforcement policy
** PingFederate OAuth Token Enforcement policy
** OpenID Connect Access Token Enforcement Policy
* Available in all organizations:
** xref:external-oauth-2.0-token-validation-policy.adoc[Mule OAuth 2.0 access token enforcement policy] and xref:mule-oauth-provider-landing-page.adoc[Mule OAuth 2.0 Provider]

Any of these token enforcement policies won't allow access to OAuth 2.0 protected resources if credentials from other than Mule client applications created in Anypoint Platform are used.

An OAuth 2.0 authorization enforcement policy, which you apply to an API in Anypoint Platform, connects to an OpenAM authorization server, an OpenID Connect Token Introspection endpoint, PingFederate authorization server, or a Mule OAuth 2.0 provider.

*Important:* The xref:external-oauth-2.0-token-validation-policy.adoc[Mule OAuth 2.0 access token enforcement policy] is designed to work exclusively with a Mule OAuth 2.0 provider. Using the policy with any other OAuth 2.0 provider (eg. Facebook, Google, or Azure) is *not supported*.

== Prerequisites

* You are an Anypoint Platform organization administrator or have permission to create or manage APIs in an environment.
* You set up your Anypoint Platform organization as a Federated organization using either OpenAM, OpenID Connect, or PingFederate. Alternatively, you have a xref:mule-oauth-provider-landing-page.adoc[Mule OAuth 2.0 Provider] configured and running.
