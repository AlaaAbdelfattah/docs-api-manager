= Manage API Group Instance Contracts
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

After you grant access to API Group instances in Exchange, a contract is automatically created between an application and the API instance. You can then manage that contract from API Manager.

//Clarify: does the contract cover the user's access to ONE API instance or to ONE API group or ONE API group instance? = 1 API, 1 group, or 1 instance of a group?
  
The API instance contract details are displayed on the API instance contracts page at two levels:

* Contracts directly made with the API instance (API instance contracts)
* Contracts made with the API groups that consist of this API instance

// I don't think that is clear enough what an Applied contract means and why this change was introduced. Also, we should specify how the applied contract is selected.
// I don't understand what are you trying to say with An application can have more than one contract with the different APIs in an API Group. --fede

.The screen capture displays the contract levels and the contract status for the API instance contracts.

An application can have multiple contracts with the different APIs in an API Group. You can view the the API instance contracts at the API Group-level. The contracts are sorted by the applications that are in contract with the API Group. The contract that is currently active within an API Group is displayed as `Applied`.
