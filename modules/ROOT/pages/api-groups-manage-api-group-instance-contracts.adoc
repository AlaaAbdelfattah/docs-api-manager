After you grant access to API Group instances in Exchange, a contract is automatically created for it. You can then manage these contracts from API Manager.

The API Instance contract details are displayed on the API instance page at two levels: all contracts that are directly with the API instance (API instance contracts) and all contracts made with the API groups that consists of this API instance.

An application can have more than one contract with the different APIs in an API Group. When you view the API instance contracts at the API Group-level, the contracts are sorted by the applications that are in contract with the API Group. The contract that is currently active within an API Group is displayed as `Applied`.

.The screen capture displays the contract levels and the contract status for the API instance contracts.
