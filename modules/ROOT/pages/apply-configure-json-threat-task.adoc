|===

JSON requests are susceptible to attacks characterized by unusual inflation of elements and nesting levels. Attackers use recursive techniques to consume memory resources. Dramatic swings in the size of the application data often signal a security problem. The JSON threat protection policy helps protect your applications from such intrusions.

If Mule runtime engine (Mule) fails to detect an attack, you must monitor and design your services architecture with layers of protection in addition to these policies.

== Configuring Policy Parameters

When you apply the policy to your API from the UI, the following parameters are displayed:

|Maximum String Value Length|Specifies the maximum length allowed for a string value ^|0 ^|false
|Maximum Object Entry Name Length|Specifies the maximum string length allowed for an object's entry name ^|0 ^|false
|Maximum Object Entry Count|Specifies the maximum number of entries allowed in an object ^|0 ^|false
