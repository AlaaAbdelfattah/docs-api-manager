Applications processing JSON requests are susceptible to attacks characterized by unusual inflation of elements and nesting levels. Attackers use recursive techniques to consume memory resources. Dramatic swings in the size of the application data often signal a security problem. The JSON Threat Protection policy helps protect your applications from such intrusions.

If any possible attacks to your Anypoint Platform setup go undetected, consider designing your services architecture with layers of protection in addition to these policies.
